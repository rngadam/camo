# Thank You for a Successful UWH Nationals 2025!

The CAMO Hockey Subaquatique team extends its heartfelt thanks to the organizers from [GO-HSA](http://go-hsa.ca) (Gatineau-Ottawa Underwater Hockey) and the international referees who officiated at the UWH Nationals 2025.

Pierre Larose of the [GO-HSA](http://go-hsa.ca) club aimed to provide an experience as close as possible to the world championships, using national-level resources, and it was a resounding success. His vision and the dedication of the organizing team were evident in every detail.

Without the exceptional organization by [GO-HSA](http://go-hsa.ca), it would not have been possible to witness the outstanding final match between Toronto and Montreal! This event truly showcased the spirit and skill of Canadian underwater hockey.

We are incredibly grateful for the hard work, passion, and commitment that made this tournament a memorable one for all participants and spectators.
